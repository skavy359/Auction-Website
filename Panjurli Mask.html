                    <p>This magnificent ancient bronze mask which is a precious collectible is that of a Panjurli. Panjurli is the divine spirit of a male wild boar worshipped as a part of Bhuta Kola. Panjurli in Tulu means a wild boar offspring. As per Paddanas â€“ the ancient Tulu oral literature, Goddess Parvati kept an offspring of a Wild boar as her pet and loved it dearly. It was very naughty and destroyed the gardens in Kailash. Lord Shiva angered by this, killed the Wild Boar. This upset Parvati greatly. To pacify her, Shiva brought it back to life as a spirit and sent it to Earth to protect the people and steer them from evil to good.</p>
                    <p>Bhuta Worship in the form of Bhuta Kola is celebrated in the Tululand (states of Southern coastal Karnataka like Mangalore, Udupi, Kundapura) and North Malabar region of Kerala and is very much a core part of the socio-cultural life in the village. Some believe the origin of Bhuta worship to be older than Hinduism itself.  A Bhuta is a divine ethereal spirit that is believed to protect and promote the welfare of its worshippers. The Bhuta kola attempts to bring together the tangible and the intangible worlds. There are at least 350 kinds of Bhutas which are classified either as those of totemic origin or derived from Hindu gods or human heroes who became saints after their death. Some believe these Bhutas to be from the sect of Ganas, followers and devotees of Lord Shiva.</p>
