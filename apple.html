            <p>The first Apple computer, the Apple I, was sold in 1976 for $666.66. The first 50 units were sold to a local computer store. In total, 200 units of Apple I were made.

                This model was essentially a circuit board. It had no case, keyboard, sound, or graphics. Computers at the time were sold as kits, but Apple I was a completely assembled board. To make a working computer, consumers needed a power supply transformer, a case, an ASCII keyboard, a power switch, and a video display.</p>
            <p>Apple I had a 6502 processor running at 1MHz and 8KB memory. The user needed a cassette tape to save the data, which was the precursor of the floppy disk. It was made up of a single motherboard and fully pre-assembled chips, and the motherboard was made to support CRT TV.All along, Apple had a vision of a low-cost, easy-to-use computer for the ordinary consumer. Lisa was the forerunner of the Macintosh, and it was advertised with Lisa as one family when it was launched. But the Macintosh delivered on Appleâ€™s original vision.</p>
